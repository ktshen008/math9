# Math 9 Introduction to Programming for Numerical Analysis 

Instructor: Peter McHale 

Course webpage: https://eee.uci.edu/17f/44600

## Getting set up (the software below is FREE!)

In what follows, you will need to access the 'command line'. 
On a Mac, this is done by opening the `Terminal` app. On the lab (Windows) machines,
this is done via `Start` -> `Anaconda Prompt` (type this into the search field to locate the program). 
Your TA will help you with this. 

If on your own machine, install Python and Jupyter by installing 
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (Python 3.x version).
 Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing.
Please 
[create a conda environment using Python 2.x](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) and [activate it](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment).
Your TA will help you with this.

If you are working at a lab computer, which already has Python and Jupyter installed, then 
type `python --version` at the command prompt to 
check the version of Python that is installed. It will hopefully say Python 2.x, which is what we will use in this course. 

Open a Jupyter notebook by navigating to the directory in which it is located (the `cd` command is useful here, 
as is the `ls` command in `Terminal` or equivalently, the `dir` command in Windows)
and typing `jupyter notebook` at the 
command prompt. 
A tab will open in your browser revealing the contents of the current directory. 
Seek out the TA for help.

Once you’re finished editing/running your notebook, press `ctrl-c`
twice at the command prompt.

If Jupyter complains that a specific package is missing when you 
run your notebook, then return to the command line, execute 
`conda install <name of package>`, and re-run the offending notebook cell. 

PLEASE BRING USB DRIVE TO LAB TO SAVE YOUR WORK.

## Book 
We will not be following a specific textbook in this course. 
However, if you would like to read a book to help you with the course, I recommend: 
[Scientific Computation: Python Hacking for Math Junkies](http://calculuscastle.com/pythonbook.html), by B. Shapiro.

## Schedule

If time permits, I will try to indicate relevant sections of Shapiro's book in the column entitled `Sections`.
